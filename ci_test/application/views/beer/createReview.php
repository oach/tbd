        					<li class="list-group-item">Choose the type of review style you prefer: normal or short.</li>
        					<li class="list-group-item">Once you choose a review type and submit your review, you will not be able to change the review type.  Choose wisely.</li>
        					<li class="list-group-item">You can change the review type from beer to beer, but we think you try to choose one that best suites your preferences.</li>
        					<li class="list-group-item">10s should be few and far between: the beer is perfect and needs no improvement.</li>
        					<li class="list-group-item">Reviews should be recent and, preferrably, from handwritten notes as it is sometimes difficult to remember the caveats of a beer.</li>
        					<li class="list-group-item">Try to review a beer with an understanding of the style of beer that it is.  Sometimes preconceived biasis on a style can cause trouble.  Understand the effort involved in brewing the style.</li>
        					<li class="list-group-item">This is not a race to see who can review the most beers in a day, week, month, year, etc.  Like your beer, enjoy the experience.</li>
