				Beer styles are an ever changing and ever evolving list.  American craft brewers can be thought of as artists and,
				like any great artist, the outstanding brewers will define and redefine a style based on their perception.  So
				beer styles should evolve in order to keep the American craft beer industry progressing forward.

				The Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) is a great way to become more involved with beer and to truly appreciate
				American craft beer.  The BJCP was founded in 1985 to promote beer literacy, appreciation of real beer, and recognize 
				beer tasting and evalution skills (from their site).  An examination is given in order to receive certification.
